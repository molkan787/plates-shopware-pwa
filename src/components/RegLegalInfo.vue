Quality Control

- 100% Road Legal
- Safe to pressure wash
- Doesn't fade in the sun


We only use the most highest and premium quality within our plates. As well as this, our plates are British manufactured components in the production of our number plates. In addition to this, we employ a stringent quality control process to ensure that all components and number plates meet our highest standard of quality.

All our number plates can be washed with a pressure washer without any fear of damaging the number plates, and they will certainly not fade in the sunlight either.

Number Plates Spacing

All number plates will be supplied to UK standards unless stated. We also offer the shortest legal spacing. Place your information on the order. We will then contact you if we have any concerns.
